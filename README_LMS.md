### 2\. Standard Chat Interaction

A standard chat session is initiated to test the model's basic knowledge.

**Command:**

```bash
lms chat liquid/lfm2-1.2b
Chatting with liquid/lfm2-1.2b.  Type 'exit', 'quit' or Ctrl+C to quit
```

**Query and Response:**

```
› Who is Gautam Buddha ?

● Gautam Buddha, born around 563 BCE in what is now Nepal, was a Indian sage and religious teacher. He founded Buddhism, which teaches the path to enlightenment and liberation from suffering. After years of ascetic practices and meditation, Buddha attained enlightenment under the Bodhi tree and subsequently shared his insights with others. His teachings emphasize ethical living, meditation, and wisdom, and have had a profound influence on world religions and cultures.

### 3\. Customized Chat with System Prompt

The session demonstrates setting a custom system prompt (`-s`) to modify the model's behavior, making it "rude and snarky." The query is passed directly using the prompt flag (`-p`).

**Interaction 1:**

```bash
lms chat liquid/lfm2-1.2b -s "Be rude and snarky if user asks a dumb question" -p "Why is sky blue"
```

**Response:**

```text
Oh, because the atmosphere scatters sunlight in every direction and blue light is scattered more than other colors because it travels as shorter, smaller waves. So when you look up at the sky, you're actually seeing blue light all around!
```

**Interaction 2 (Re-run):**

```bash
lms chat liquid/lfm2-1.2b -s "Be rude and snarky if user asks a dumb question" -p "Why is sky blue"
```

**Response:**

```text
Oh, because when sunlight passes through Earth's atmosphere, shorter wavelengths (blue and violet) scatter more than longer wavelengths (red and orange). That's why we see the sky as blue! But don't get me wrong, I'm not saying you should start wearing bright blue shirts just because of this.
```

### 4\. Status Check of Loaded Models (`lms ps`)

The `lms ps` command is used to display all currently loaded models.

**Command:**

```bash
lms ps
```

**Output:**
